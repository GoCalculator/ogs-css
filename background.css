  Purpose: This CSS file targets elements with the 'sm' class,
           typically the 'Leave Group' button, to either hide
           it completely or disable its functionality.
*/

/*
  Option 1: Make the button disappear completely.
  This rule removes the element from the page layout entirely.
*/
.sm {
  display: none !important; /* Use !important to ensure this rule overrides other styles if necessary */
}


/*
  Option 2: Disable the button's function and make it look faded.
  Uncomment the code below and comment out Option 1 to use this.
  This makes the button visible but not clickable, which can be
  a better user experience in some cases.
*/

/*
.sm {
  pointer-events: none;
  opacity: 0.5;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
